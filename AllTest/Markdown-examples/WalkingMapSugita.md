##Walking Maps

####Wildwood park to Down town park
This walk starts off at Wildwood park with open green space and a flower garden. Then, we across the Old Bellevue Main Street. I often find pretty shops and restaurants there --one of the fun parts in this walk. Maybe after grabbing some snack at one of your favorite shops in Old Bellevue, we'll see the beautiful view of Downtown park. Enjoy this peaceful and restful park.

####148th Ave Coffee Shop to Robinswood Park
This walk starts off at 148th Ave Coffee Shop-- just behind the Bellevue College campus. Their coffee baristas are really nice people but you also will like the coffee they make! They also provide a nice chilly atmospher with good songs. You'll see a lot of students study, chat, and relax there. it's nice to enjoy the coffee there, but if you across the 148th ave, you also can enjoy the coffee in a beautiful green environment. This is my favorite spot walking with my dog.

####Mercer Way Bus Stop to Mercerdale Park
One day when I still didn't have a car and needed to take bus, my buy didn't come for 2 hours because of the traffic due to some event in Seattle. It's boring just watching cars and hoping the bus to come, I started walking around and found a nice park called Mercerdale park. They had some event at that time and later I figured that they often organize some event. Was good place to chill when I had prenty
